Principal component analysis is used as a dimensionality reduction technique for unsupervised learning data. 
The dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/ruslankl/mice-protein-expression. The  data set  consists  of  the  expression levels  of 77  pro-teins/protein modifications that produced detectable signals in the nuclear fraction ofcortex.  There are 38 control mice and 34 trisomic mice (Down syndrome), for a totalof 72 mice.  In the experiments,  15 measurements were registered of each protein persample/mouse.  Therefore, for control mice, there are 38x15, or 570 measurements, andfor trisomic mice, there are 34x15, or 510 measurements.  The dataset contains a total of1080 measurements per protein. Each measurement can be considered as an independentsample/mouse.
These 77 dimensions were reduced to 2 dimension using Principal component analysis.
